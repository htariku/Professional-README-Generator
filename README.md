   # Installation: 
   The following must be installed to run the application properly: to generate your own README, you have to first create your own repository and clone it locally. Then run npm install in order to install the npm package (inquirer and package.JSON). Now the application will be able to run node index.js in the command line. After you have input your questions within the index.js file they should appear in the command line for you to answer and automatically generate a README. Along with the README, it will also generate your license badge using shields.io.
